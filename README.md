# Data Science Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my Data Science portfolio. This repository showcases some of the key projects I have worked on. My passion for solving real-world problems using data has led me to undertake various projects where I applied data wrangling, machine learning, deep learning, and more to gain insights and make predictions. Below is a brief overview of my projects:

## DATA SCIENCE JOB SALARIES – Personal Project – Toronto, CA – July 2023
- **Objective**: Predict job salaries in the data science field.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Built a web scraper to collect 750 real-time data science job listings from Glassdoor.
  - Utilized NLP to create a word cloud from job descriptions.
  - Performed EDA using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
  - Cleaned and analyzed the job listings dataset.
  - Implemented Machine Learning techniques for salary prediction with feature engineering.
  - Developed a Flask API to serve the random forest model for salary prediction.

## REAL ESTATE EDA AND PRICE PREDICTION – Personal Project – Toronto, CA – June 2023
- **Objective**: Predict real estate market prices.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Preprocessed a dataset of 1460 real estate listings.
  - Conducted data visualization and exploration to identify key market features.
  - Used linear regression and PCA for price predictions.
  - Applied deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras for advanced price prediction.

## AIRBNB SYDNEY DATA ANALYSIS – Personal Project – Toronto, CA – June 2023
- **Objective**: Extract key business intelligences to improve Airbnb sales performance in Sydney.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Employed SQL to extract data from 4 related Airbnb Sydney database tables.
  - Aggregated and filtered data for enhanced reporting.
  - Loaded and visualized data using Python SQLAlchemy to identify key sales performance metrics.

## RECOMMENDER SYSTEM FOR MOVIES DATASET – Personal Project – Toronto, CA – May 2023
- **Objective**: Build a movie recommender system.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Created a simple recommender system using a dataset of 100,000 movie ratings.
  - Explored and aggregated data to identify similarly rated movies.
  - Visualized data insights using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
