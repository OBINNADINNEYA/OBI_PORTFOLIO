# Data Science Portfolio - [OBINNA DINNEYA]

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository showcases my expertise in predictive modeling, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning through a range of projects I've undertaken. Based in Toronto, CA, my passion lies in extracting insights from data and building models that inform and inspire actionable outcomes.

## üçè Personal Apple Watch HRV (SDNN) Prediction - October 2023
In this project, I delved into the world of health analytics. By analyzing the impact of physical activities like walking and running on Heart Rate Variability (HRV), this project sheds light on autonomic nervous system activity and cardiovascular health.
- **Key Achievements**: 
  - Built a decision tree, optimized a random forest model, and designed a five-layer neural network for precise HRV predictions.
  - Successfully modified my health routine, improving HRV readings based on the findings.

## üè° Real Estate EDA and Price Prediction - June 2023
This initiative revolves around the real estate market in Toronto. Leveraging a dataset of 1,460 listings, I executed extensive exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and built prediction models to forecast real estate prices.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Effectively visualized and explored the dataset using tools like Seaborn and Pandas.
  - Built linear regression and principal component analysis models for price prediction.
  - Deployed deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras for advanced price predictions.
