# Data Science Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my Data Science portfolio. This repository showcases some of the key projects I have worked on. My passion for solving real-world problems using data has led me to undertake various projects where I applied data wrangling, machine learning, deep learning, and more to gain insights and make predictions. Below is a brief overview of my projects:

## REAL ESTATE EDA AND PRICE PREDICTION – Personal Project – Toronto, CA – June 2023

- **Key Tasks**:
  - Preprocessed a dataset of 1460 real estate listings.
  - Conducted data visualization and exploration to identify key market features.
  - Used linear regression and PCA for price predictions.
  - Applied deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras for advanced price prediction.

## AIRBNB SYDNEY DATA ANALYSIS – Personal Project – Toronto, CA – June 2023
